Due to it's alpha quality the software may break, so use at your own risk !

TODO:
-Windows host support
-more tests and stability
-write pyQt4 GUI for it

Small things TODO:
-audio
-network
-add ability to customize unattended script (for advanced users) - 
it will let us surpass proprietary competition. (on the second thought, 
it probably doesn't improve productivity - 
advanced admins can customize their OS either way - however, it is _very_ useful for education)
-auto-detect host OS language and keybd layout and recommend this for Linux guests.
-Install OS into RAM disk then deploy to HDD ?
Linux integration:
-default timezone = London ? UTC or localtime ?
